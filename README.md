# Isocrunch
Welcome to IsoCrunch! Our goal is to help people stay active and healthy at home and on the go, using absolutely no equipment!
Through an easy to follow UI, users select the muscles that they wish to target, the amount of time (in minutes), and the difficulty level of the exercises! As you can see, this is quite effective at allowing a wide range of exercise routines. Need a quick 5-minute power workout to wake up? IsoCrunch has just the thing. Want a targeted back exercise workout day? IsoCrunch has that too! Want to start getting into whole body exercises? IsoCrunch has it all!
IsoCrunch stands out from the pack by making all our exercises require no equipment. We understand the limits of on the go workouts and at home gyms, so we want to make workout routines accessible anywhere, anytime. Our workout plan uses scientifically backed methods with a High Intensity Interval Training workout with a 40/20 second on and off principle. This is very effective at building muscle and endurance.
